# Numerical Optimization with Interior Point Method

This project implements an interior point method solver for small constrained optimization problems. The solver is designed to handle both linear programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) problems. The project includes functions for computing gradients and Hessians with log-barrier terms, solving the KKT system, and plotting the results.
